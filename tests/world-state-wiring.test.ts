/**
 * The `Game`'s writes to its `WorldState` go through the module's writers.
 *
 * `world-state.ts`'s `withEnvelope` carries three things a hand-rolled write
 * does not: the galaxy bound, the `at < gameTime` refusal, and `materializeDue`
 * before the edit. Its own comment says a fifth writer "should not have to
 * rediscover the sequence" — and the fifth writer was in `main.ts`, which
 * spread a replacement envelope in by hand and set
 * `gameTime: this.world.gameTime / 60`.
 *
 * **That division is the defect, not a style point.** `World.gameTime` is
 * seconds (`sim.ts`); a `DeficitRow.updatedAt` is game minutes
 * (`deficits.ts`). A caller holding both must convert one of them at exactly
 * one boundary, and the hand-rolled write converted the world clock instead of
 * the row's stamp — so the first save taken after a trade would carry a clock
 * sixty times too small, and every `completesAt` in the snapshot would then sit
 * in the future for an hour of play.
 *
 * `Game` is not constructible headless — it builds a renderer — so this reads
 * the source. A source assertion is what `tests/output-stage.test.ts` and
 * `tests/headless.test.ts` already do for the same reason, and the alternative
 * is the wire being checked by nothing at all until a browser probe notices.
